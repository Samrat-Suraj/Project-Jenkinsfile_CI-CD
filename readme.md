# Docker Compose Project

This project demonstrates how to set up and run a Docker Compose-based environment with a bind-mounted volume and a custom build.

---

## 🐳 Prerequisites

Make sure Docker and Docker Compose are installed:

```bash
docker --version
docker-compose --version
````

---

## 📦 Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Samrat-Suraj/Docker_Compose_Project.git
cd Docker_Compose_Project

## 📁 Create a Named Bind Volume

Create a Docker volume that binds to a specific host directory:

```bash
docker volume create \
  --name frokfly_volume \
  --opt type=none \
  --opt device=/home/suraj/Documents/frokfly_volume \
  --opt o=bind
```

Ensure the `/home/suraj/Documents/frokfly_volume` directory exists on your host system.
